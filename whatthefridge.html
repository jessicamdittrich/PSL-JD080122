            <p>Team member William had a predicament where he had food in his fridge and wanted to create something flavourful but didn't know where to start. By creating this application, him and many others can input their ingredients and have recipes picked out that they can use to make something new. In addition to this, eco-friendly individuals can also input their fridge contents and find recipes to use them which combats food waste.</p>
