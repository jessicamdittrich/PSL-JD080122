        <h3>I'm doing things a little different here...</h3>
        <p>This isn't your average application. Why? Well I'm not your average applicant. I have worked in over five different industries where I excelled and proved to be asset. My well rounded skills make me the perfect candidate for this position as well as my passion for people, and the planet.</p>
        <p>I hope this shows you how serious I am about this position and how much effort I put into what I do.</p>

        <h3>My unconventional cover letter</h3>
        <p>To Kamea &/ Scott &/ Tammy, </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>I consider myself to be an eco-conscious individual to the point where my loved ones will roll their eyes. In my day to day life, I am a wife, dog mom, daughter, sister, friend, organization freak, appreciator of all art forms, juggler of tasks, sustainability advocate, hater of fast fashion, and much more. I have worked in several industries from accounting, customer service, graphic design, project management, property management, web design, and I even was an executive assistant. I'm from the Vancouver Lower Mainland, in BC Canada and currently reside in North Vancouver.</p>
        <p>Right now, I work in the corporate world but I know it's not for me. What interests me in working for Green Dreamer is that this is a brand I whole heartedly can support and stand behind. This internship would be a great transition for me out of corporate which is ultimately one of my goals.</p>
        <p>I'm <strong>the</strong> ideal candidate because I have so much drive and passion in this space and in everything I do. I love to look at the world and even any task with a positive mindset. I am a glass half full person. I want to be a part of this and I will put passion into this position.</p>
        <p>What I hope to learn and gain is more knowledge of the world and understanding of why we are where we are today. I know I can learn so much based off of the few podcast episodes that I have listened to. This opportunity has inspired me. It's also been an interest of mine to acquire video and audio editting skills and this is the perfect setting for me to learn.</p>
        <p>The hourly rate of $18.00 is a great start for me as I adjust and grow into this role, and hopefully contribute to the brand.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p>Jessica Dittrich</p>

        <h3>This role's responsibilities don't scare me</h3>
        <p>I have experience in multiple different fields and at the end of the day I know how to get the job done. See below a list of my previous responsibilities that relate to the Production Management Intern role.</p>
        <uL>
            <li>During most of my positions i've had constant influx of emails. Managing inboxes is exciting for me. I always like to end the day with an empty inbox (if possible), and past managers have even asked me tips on keeping their inbox organized.</li>
            <li>I've worked multiple jobs, but most currently at BGIS in my role as Tenant Services Coordinator, I am the point of contact with clients leading the relationship, connecting and building the relationship, scheduling services while taking into account several schedules. Two months into my role at BGIS and I have received positive emails about my communication style.</li>
            <li>As I said previously, I consider myself an organizational freak which is how I navigated my role as Project Manager for Tobimax Textiles based out of Taiwan. I oversaw and kept track of all internal communication and communication with clients to allow for easily accessible tracking of promised, kept, and behind schedules. I had to navigate different time zones while I worked remote and communicated with the factory in Taiwan and clients based all around the world.</li>
            <li>At Sutton Select Property Management and BGIS I've dealt with meeting minutes, and I'm familiar with using Canva from recreational use and my time at Tobimax Textiles. I am always taking notes and take pride in making them look presentable to others.</li>
            <li>I pride myself on positive interactions and building relationships. During the beginning of COVID-19 I took on the task of reaching out to hospitals to see if they were in need of PPE because Tobimax Textiles had the means to supply the demand. Although none were successful due to rapidly changing regulations, I made contact with multiple individuals and organizations.</li>

        <h3>My values align with Green Dreamer's</h3>
        <p>When I read what Green Dreamer was about and Kamea's personal note, I could not relate to anything more. I too have this constant feeling of helplessness, hopelessness, and uncertaintly of what I can do to help make a difference in this world. <em>Embarked on my personal "conscious lifestyle" journey</em> - so have I. I want to be a part of this. Be a part of its growth and contributions to the world. I know I can learn a lot in this space and grow as an individual.</p>
        <p>This wouldn't just be a job for me. This would be an outlet for personal and professional growth. A passion to do better and be better.</p>

        <h3>Is it really time for you to go?</h3>
        <p>In closing, I want to thank you for taking the time to read through my application. I hope I get the chance to discuss this further in an interview. I would love to be alongside you on this journey. Thank you for your consideration.</p>
